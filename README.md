## 1️⃣ Category Contribution Analysis

**Business Question:**  
Which product categories generate the most revenue?

**SQL Approach:**
- JOIN SalesOrderDetail → Product → ProductSubcategory → ProductCategory
- GROUP BY Category
- SUM(LineTotal)

**Insight:**  
Revenue is highly concentrated in major product categories (e.g., Bikes dominate overall sales).

---

## 2️⃣ Best Selling Product per Category

**Business Question:**  
Which product drives maximum revenue in each category?

**SQL Approach:**
- GROUP BY Product
- Used ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY Category

**Insight:**  
Each category has a clear top-performing product contributing majority revenue.

---

## 3️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend

**Business Question:**  
How are sales changing over time?

**SQL Approach:**
- Extract YEAR and MONTH from OrderDate
- SUM(TotalDue)

**Python:**
- Created Date column
- Generated Line Chart

**Insight:**  
Sales show trend behavior with seasonal variations and growth patterns.

---

## 4️⃣ Year-over-Year Growth

**Business Question:**  
Is the business growing year by year?

**SQL:**
- GROUP BY Year
- SUM(TotalDue)

**Python:**
```python
df['YoY_%'] = df['TotalSales'].pct_change() * 100
```

**Insight:**  
Business shows measurable annual growth with positive performance trends.

---

## 5️⃣ Top 10 Customers

**Business Question:**  
Who are the most valuable customers?

**SQL:**
- GROUP BY CustomerID
- ORDER BY TotalSales DESC

**Insight:**  
Revenue is concentrated among high-value customers.

---

## 6️⃣ Customer Segmentation

**Business Question:**  
How to classify customers based on spending?

**Python:**
```python
df['Segment'] = pd.qcut(df['TotalSales'], q=3, labels=['Low','Medium','High'])
```

**Insight:**  
Customers segmented into Low, Medium, and High spenders for targeted strategy.

---

## 7️⃣ Sales by Territory

**Business Question:**  
Which regions perform best?

**SQL:**

Which products are underperforming?

**SQL:**
- Total sales per product

## 🔟 Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)

**Business Question:**  
Do 20% of products generate 80% of revenue?

**Python:**
```python
df['CumSales%'] = df['Sales'].cumsum() / df['Sales'].sum() * 100
```
